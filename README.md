## Projects Overview

### 1. **AI Chatbot (GUI Based)**  
A simple AI chatbot built using Python and Tkinter. It responds to basic user messages using simple if-else logic. This project helped me understand how chatbots can interact with users in a basic way.

### 2. **COVID-19 Data Visualization**  
In this project, I used `Pandas` to analyze COVID-19 data and `Matplotlib` for visualization. I plotted daily cases, analyzed trends, and gained insight into how data visualization works in real-world datasets.

### 3. **Word Frequency Counter**  
This Jupyter Notebook takes a paragraph of text and counts the frequency of each word. It helped me get started with text processing and understanding how simple word counting works in Python.
